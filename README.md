# DESCRIPTION:

A Tip Calculator is a mobile application designed to assist users in quickly and accurately calculating tips and splitting bills at
restaurants, cafes, or other places where tipping is customary. It provides a convenient way to determine how much to tip service staff, such as waiters, bartenders, and delivery drivers, and helps users distribute the total bill among a group of diners or friends.


# FEATURES:

1. Bill Input: Users can input the total bill amount, which includes the cost of meals, drinks, and any additional charges or taxes.

2. Tip Percentage Selection: The app allows users to choose a tip percentage, usually ranging from 10% to 30% or more. It may also offer a custom tip option.

3. Tip Amount Calculation: The app calculates the tip amount based on the selected tip percentage and the total bill amount.
